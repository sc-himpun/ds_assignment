Acme Corp migrated to the cloud in 2021. 
Rather than choosing AWS or Azure, the company adopted a private OpenStack deployment called “Nimbus”. 
All customer-facing applications run on this cloud, and the policy states that no data is stored outside India. 
In 2023, the IT governance board mandated that Kubernetes clusters must be provisioned only using Acme’s internal tool “SkyPilot”. 
The company currently maintains 15 Kubernetes clusters, each mapped to a business unit.
