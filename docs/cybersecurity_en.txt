Acme Corp follows a “Red-Blue-Purple” team model for cybersecurity. 
The Red team runs monthly penetration tests, while the Blue team handles incident response. 
In 2024, Acme introduced a Purple team that ensures knowledge sharing between both. 
The company maintains its own in-house Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system named “Sentinel-X”. 
One unusual policy is that all employees must rotate their workstation password every 22 days, instead of the industry-standard 90 days.
