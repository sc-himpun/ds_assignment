The Machine Learning group at Acme Corp manages models under the platform “AcmeML Hub”. 
Unlike most companies, they do not allow Jupyter notebooks in production; instead, experiments must be run via YAML pipelines. 
In 2023, they deployed a fraud detection model with the codename “EagleEye”, which reduced false positives by 12%. 
All ML models must pass fairness checks for gender and regional bias before deployment. 
The default training infrastructure is a GPU cluster with 40 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.
