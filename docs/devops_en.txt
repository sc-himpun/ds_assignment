The DevOps team at Acme Corp uses a custom CI/CD pipeline manager called “RapidDeploy”, built internally in 2020. 
All production deployments must pass a 4-stage pipeline: Build, Test, Security Scan, and Canary Release. 
Developers are required to containerize applications using Podman instead of Docker. 
In 2022, the CTO mandated that rollback time for failed deployments must be under 7 minutes. 
By 2024, RapidDeploy had orchestrated over 18,000 successful deployments across different divisions.
