The Web Development team at Acme Corp uses a framework called “NovaJS”, built internally on top of React. 
NovaJS introduces strict accessibility compliance checks in the build pipeline. 
Since 2022, all company websites must achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance before launch. 
A unique feature of NovaJS is the “UI Contract Tests” which validate component consistency across browsers. 
As of 2024, NovaJS is in version 3.2 and used in 27 production applications.
