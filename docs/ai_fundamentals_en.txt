At Acme Corp, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is categorized into three internal tiers: Assistive AI, Advisory AI, and Autonomous AI. 
Unlike typical definitions, Assistive AI here refers specifically to bots that handle repetitive business emails. 
Advisory AI is used in financial forecasting, where models generate risk reports for quarterly meetings. 
Autonomous AI is only deployed in warehouse robotics, under the project codename “Atlas”.
In 2024, the AI Fundamentals team declared that all Advisory AI systems must be auditable with weekly compliance reports.
